I am currently pursuing an MSc in Computer Science at the University of Crete. My thesis focuses on applying Generative Models in Deep Learning to address challenges in image super-resolution, employing advanced techniques such as Diffusion and Latent Diffusion Models. My primary interest lies in leveraging Deep Learning to tackle challenges in Computer Vision.
