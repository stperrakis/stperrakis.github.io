I am currently pursuing an MSc in Computer Science 🎓 at the University of Crete. My thesis focuses on applying Generative Models in Deep Learning 💻 to address challenges in image super-resolution 🔍, employing advanced techniques such as Diffusion and Latent Diffusion Models. My primary interest lies in leveraging Deep Learning to tackle challenges in Computer Vision 👀.
