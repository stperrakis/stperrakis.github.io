I am a PhD student in Digital Pathology 🧬 at CentraleSupélec, where I focus on applying Deep Learning to solve real-world problems in medical imaging. I hold an MSc in Computer Science 🎓 from the University of Crete, where my thesis explored the application of Generative Models in Deep Learning 💻 for image super-resolution 🔍, leveraging state-of-the-art techniques such as Diffusion and Latent Diffusion Models. My core interest lies in pushing the boundaries of Computer Vision 👀 through advanced AI methodologies.
